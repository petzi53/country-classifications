There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for coding. The goal of {**glossary**} is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.

See [getting started](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/articles/glossary.html) for more details.
