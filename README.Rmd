This Quarto book collects my research on different country classification schemata. Researchers can use the data files of this repo to categorize country data of varying provenience.

While researching country datasets, I experienced the problem of adequately analyzing and representing this manifold data. One needs a categorization scheme with about 250 countries or regions to summarize the data into plausible groups.
