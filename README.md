This Quarto book collects my research on different country
classification schemata. Researchers can use the data files of this repo
to categorize country data of varying provenience.

While researching country datasets, I experienced the problem of
adequately analyzing and representing this manifold data. One needs a
categorization scheme with about 250 countries or regions to summarize
the data into plausible groups.
